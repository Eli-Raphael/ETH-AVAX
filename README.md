# AutoDoor contract

## Description

The AutoDoor Contract is my attempt to peek further into the role or capabilities of blockchain in manipulating technology, I was thinking IoT and anything related.

### Executing program

To run this program, you can use Remix, an online Solidity IDE. 

Go to the Remix website at https://remix.ethereum.org/ then create a new file by clicking on the "+" icon in the left-hand sidebar. Save the file with a .sol extension.

To compile the code, click on the "Solidity Compiler" tab in the left-hand sidebar. Make sure the "Compiler" option is set to "0.8.11" (or another compatible version), and then click on the "Compile HelloWorld.sol" button.

Once the code is compiled, click the "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab in the left-hand sidebar. Select the "AutoDoor" contract from the dropdown menu, and then click on the "Deploy" button.

Below the deploy button you will see the "Deployed contract" where you can manipulate or call on the code and its functions using the user interface. Here you can test the interactions with the different functions as the owner and as other users.
